## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## HTML
When creating a website, HTML is a good language used on web pages. HTML elements is a type of code that made up of different sets of characters. They can also be called as tag. They usually defined as a starting tag which also has an ending tag at the end of the code, and the code between at is the main component of creating the website. HTML elements can have attributes and content, which can be headings, paragraphs, links, lists, embedded media, or any other format.
	HTML elements can placed into two different groups: block level and inline level. The former makes up the document's structure, while the latter dress up the contents of a block. In addition, Block elements occupy 100% of the available width and have a newline character before and after. Inline elements will only take up the space needed.

## IDE
IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. This software is used to debug, compile, and run the code. It is a software that can build applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface. IDE’s can support one or multiple languages of code. IDLE is an IDE that only supports python code. Visual studios, once downloaded the correct language, can support multiple languages.

## Angular
[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a popular TypeScript framework that is used to create web applications. It started out being used to make single paged applications but after the rapid growth in popularity of other JS frameworks such as React.js, it received many additional features to make it better suited for a variety of different application types. One of the things that Angular users particularly like is that Angular is based in TypeScript. A common criticism of JavaScript is the lack of type restrictions. In JavaScript a variable could be any type and a function could return any type but in TypeScript, these types must be predefined which helps provide clarity and assurance that the return data type of a function will always be the one desired.	

Another thing about angular that makes it appealing is that it is backed by Google which helps developers be more confident that Angular will be maintained for longer and receive more support throughout its lifetime. Angular is also an extremely popular framework and with popularity comes lots of contributions from other developers. Angular has thousands of different components that developers made and share which makes it very easy to get complex web components running on your own page just by bringing in the one the other developer made.

## React

React is a JavaScript library that is most prominently used for building interactive user interfaces for websites and applications. React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walker, a software engineer at Facebook, and the library was implemented into the company’s newsfeed the same year and Instagram’s the subsequent year. Facebook didn’t release React as we know it to the public until May of 2013, but ever since then it has been an open source software maintained by thousands of individuals.

Prior to the creation of React, developers had to essentially create user interfaces from scratch. This system was inefficient and it increased the risk of coding errors. Code within the React library is reusable and accessible to all, which effectively decreases development time and risk of programmer error. One of the major features of React is that developers can make large changes to their user interface components without reloading entire pages worth of content. This is most helpful when creating dynamic websites, where user interaction with the page is prominent. For some cool examples of sites that were built atop React, check out Netflix, Reddit, Dropbox, Facebook, and many more!

## Vue.js

Vue.js (pronounced the same as ‘view’) is a progressive Javascript framework used for developing user interfaces. Designed to be adoptable, Vue's basics are relatively easy to understand and can easily be integrated into existing projects and libraries. Vue enables developers to extend HTML and HTML attributes with directives, special tokens in markup that indicate how the library should handle certain Document Object Model (DOM) elements. Directives can be built-in or user defined.

Vue is similar to React in purpose, but each have different pros and cons. Ease of integration is a common praise for Vue and a less strict learning curve is also a relevant bonus. Vue was created by one man named Evan You and has always been open-source, relying heavily on community support. He created Vue to combine features from already popular frameworks like React and Angular.

## MySQL

MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS) with a client-server model. RDBMS is a software or service used to create and manage databases based on a relational model. MySQL allow clients to connect to a server through a network. The client can make requests to the server using a graphical user interface (GUI). There are a lot of GUIs that support MySQL. Some of the most popular GUIs are MySQL WorkBench, SequelPro, DBVisualizer, and the Navicat DB Admin Tool.

Using a desired GUI the server, then, fulfills the request as long as both client-server understand the instruction. In simplified terms, MySQL  creates a database for storing and manipulating data then allows clients to use SQL statements to make requests allowing the server to provide the required information. The simplicity of MySQL makes it easy to use while offering high performance as it is able to tore wide array of data. In addition, MySQL has a high security level making it attractive to larger companies. The final link below gives an idea of some of the companies that use MySQL.
