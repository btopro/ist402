# Glossary
Write a paragraph explaining the term below, including 2-3 relevent links to more information about the topic.

## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## HTML
HTML, or "HyperText Markup Language", is a markup language used primarily for front-end web development.  It represents objects using tags, and allows programmers to instantiate objects thereby creating a document which is viewable through use of a web browser.  See the below links for some examples and further information.

## CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to manipulate the presentation of an HTML document. It is used to simplify the process of making web pages look presentable. It is used to define styles for web pages, including design, layout and variations in display for different screen sizes. Some advantages in using CSS are that it saves time, helps pages load faster, is easy to maintain, fits the global web standards, and has superior styles to HTML.

## Vue.js
Vue.js is a front end JavaScript framework used for building user applications and interfaces. Similar yet different from React and Angular, Vue can be used in conjunction with frameworks like Electron to build both web applications and mobile and desktop apps. With its main feature being incremental adoption, Vue is one of the most easily adoptable JavaScript frameworks, allowing you to slowly implement Vue into an existing project rather than having to implement it all at once. The one big drawback of Vue is that it remains exclusively focued on the view layer, meaning that to build functionality such as routing, build tooling, and state management, you need to use external supporting libraries and packages.
Vue.js is an open source framework/library that is primarily used for UI development and Design. Focused on the View Layer only hence the name.

## Golang


## SQL
  SQL is a relational database language. A sample of SQL code: `SELECT * FROM Schools`, which returns all the results from the Schools table. 
  SQL can get very confusing as the commands get longer and longer. For the most part, SQL is used to store, create, read, and delete data from a relational database (Database that has connectiong between tables and other databases). It is the most user friendly database language.

## MySQL
MySQL is an relational database management system (RDBMS). It is an open-source system and is a common option for storage of information in databases primarily used in financial records, personnel data, and more since the 1980s. MySQL organizes data into tables with relations that help structure the data. One of the differences between SQL and MySQL is that SQL is a programming language while MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database within a computer's storage system.

## WebAssembly


## Python
Python is a high-level programming language that was released in 1991.  It has become increasingly popular among developers, due to its usability and general ease (expressing concepts is so much easier than Java, C++ or C).

  Here is a fun fact:
    -the name inspiration came from the BBC tv show "Monty Python's Flying Circus" (IMO it should be from Monty        Python and the Holy Grail)

## Accessibility / A11y

Accessibility is creating a website that can be used by all people, no matter how they get the information from the site. Some examples of ways people need special accomdendations to browse sites include:

* voice over
* keyboard controls
* audio file transcripts
* alternative text for images

Implementing accessibility is important because just like busniess are required to make their space usable for all people, including those with disabilies, websites must be avaible to all people to use. Some tools developers can use to manage accssibility inclde Lighthouse, and WAVE.

## User Experience / Usability
User Experience is really important to creating a easily usable product. This means any given user has an positive experience beacuse of the meangingful and relevant design. While usability is really important to creating this positive experience, it is not everything. User Experience encompasses the whole interactrion, starting with branding and design and including the usability and function of the product. A good User Experience is meeting every users needs, specific to them. Learn more at the [Interaction Design Foundation] (https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design)
