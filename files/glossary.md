## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## HTML
When creating a website, HTML is a good language used on web pages. HTML elements is a type of code that made up of different sets of characters. They can also be called as tag. They usually defined as a starting tag which also has an ending tag at the end of the code, and the code between at is the main component of creating the website. HTML elements can have attributes and content, which can be headings, paragraphs, links, lists, embedded media, or any other format.
	HTML elements can placed into two different groups: block level and inline level. The former makes up the document's structure, while the latter dress up the contents of a block. In addition, Block elements occupy 100% of the available width and have a newline character before and after. Inline elements will only take up the space needed.

HTML, also known as Hypertext Markup Language, is a popular coding language that communicates directly with a web browser to display text, images, and other multimedia to a webpage. HTML works on all major web browsers, as well as mobile web browsers. In order to tell a browser how to format and organize content, HTML tags can be used. These tags contain attributes enclosed within brackets, which can be further explained in the links below. 

When using HTML, it is somewhat difficult to convey an aesthetically-pleasing design. For this reason, many programmers will also incorporate CSS, known as cascading stylesheet. This language can assist HTML in making cleaner, more easy-to-understand designs. One common argument regarding HTML is the usability of this programming language. When designing simple websites, HTML is quite useful and can perform most tasks with relative ease. However, on a larger scale with more complex designs, the incorporation of CSS is somewhat needed. I feel that most programmers need some common knowledge of HTML, but when it comes to designing large projects HTML can become quite tedious to code.

## Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[9] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

## WordPress CMS
A Content Management System (CMS) is a type of software that helps users in managing and creating digital content. WordPress is an open-source CMS-based system that allows users to create customized blogs and websites. Being an open-source platform, WordPress has a multitude of developers that constantly update and add new features for free. Sites can be hosted on the WordPress server, or can be downloaded onto personal web hosts. 

The level of customization is what makes the platform so sucessful. Users can design a site using preinstalled themes and templates (no programming experience required), or create a site from scratch using PHP on a Linux or Windows OS. A vast amount of plugins can be installed into a WordPress site, such as SEO tools, security features, eCommerce solutions, among many others.

## VSCode
VS Code, or Visual Studio Code, is a cross-platform (uniform environment) source-code editor, released in April 2015 by Microsoft. It is free for both commercial and private use, and is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. It’s source code is open source. It is based on the Electron framework (developed by GitHub).The editor is Microsoft’s Monaco. It is praised for being “lean, customizable, and fast.” It is a very popular editor, having [2.6 million monthly active](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/11/16/connect) users in 2017.

It supports many common languages such as JavaScript and CSS. Even more languages can be found through extensions (Through the VSCode marketplace). These extensions range in functionality from adding a new theme to sharing code in real-time (Live Code extension). VSCode is extremely customizable in this way. The program also features built-in git (commit from the editor) as well as IntelliSense and debugging (Node.js). Other features include syntax highlighting, code refactoring, and bracket matching.

## TravisCI
Travis CI is service used to build and test software projects that are hosted on Github. The <b> CI </b> in TravisCI stands for continious integeration, the practicce of merging developers code to share a main codebase together. Travis CI has provided a testing base for over 900,000 open source projects. The following list is large software companies that trust Travis CI's work;
* Zendesk
* Engine Yard
* Heroku
* BitTorrent
* Moz

The software pipeline that Travis CI follows is the following; <i> push code to github --> Travis CI is triggered by Github to start a build of the project --> Travis will run the project through a series of tests --> If the build passes, Travis CI will deploy the application to Heroku --> Travis CI will then automatically send out a message to infom the software team that the build was successful. </i>

## SEO
[SEO](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en) stands for “search engine optimization.” It is the primary way to get traffic from the “free,” “organic,” “editorial” or “natural” search results on search engines. Google ranks webpages and websites that will be listed first on search results, by the meta tags that are listed on indivudual webpages. Companies put relevant name tags on their webpages that searchers may be interested in.

SEO is the magic you have to work on your article in order to make Google very likely to list your post as one of the top search results whenever someone searches for that keyword. Some marketing experts often specialize in SEO because it is vital for businesses to have proper meta tags on their webpages, in order to be on the top of the google results, which usually brings in more traffic, which ultimately helps the business grow. 

### Reasons companies pour so much money into SEO and understanding SEO:
- To get new people directed to their site
- Helps company make money
- Builds brand recognition
- Keeps company relevant amongst competitors

## Express.js
Express is the most popular Node web framework. Express.js is a web application framework that helps organize a web application into a MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture on the server side of the application. To go even further, a developer can use MongoDB with Mongoose (for modeling) to provide a backend for the application. Express.js helps manage everything, from routes, to handling requests and views. Express also provides methods to specify what function is called for a particular HTTP request (GET, POST) and methods to specify what template ("view") engine is used.

## Angular
[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a popular TypeScript framework that is used to create web applications. It started out being used to make single paged applications but after the rapid growth in popularity of other JS frameworks such as React.js, it received many additional features to make it better suited for a variety of different application types. One of the things that Angular users particularly like is that Angular is based in TypeScript. A common criticism of JavaScript is the lack of type restrictions. In JavaScript a variable could be any type and a function could return any type but in TypeScript, these types must be predefined which helps provide clarity and assurance that the return data type of a function will always be the one desired.	

Another thing about angular that makes it appealing is that it is backed by Google which helps developers be more confident that Angular will be maintained for longer and receive more support throughout its lifetime. Angular is also an extremely popular framework and with popularity comes lots of contributions from other developers. Angular has thousands of different components that developers made and share which makes it very easy to get complex web components running on your own page just by bringing in the one the other developer made.

## React

React is a JavaScript library that is most prominently used for building interactive user interfaces for websites and applications. React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walker, a software engineer at Facebook, and the library was implemented into the company’s newsfeed the same year and Instagram’s the subsequent year. Facebook didn’t release React as we know it to the public until May of 2013, but ever since then it has been an open source software maintained by thousands of individuals.

Prior to the creation of React, developers had to essentially create user interfaces from scratch. This system was inefficient and it increased the risk of coding errors. Code within the React library is reusable and accessible to all, which effectively decreases development time and risk of programmer error. One of the major features of React is that developers can make large changes to their user interface components without reloading entire pages worth of content. This is most helpful when creating dynamic websites, where user interaction with the page is prominent. For some cool examples of sites that were built atop React, check out Netflix, Reddit, Dropbox, Facebook, and many more!

## Vue.js

Vue.js (pronounced the same as ‘view’) is a progressive Javascript framework used for developing user interfaces. Designed to be adoptable, Vue's basics are relatively easy to understand and can easily be integrated into existing projects and libraries. Vue enables developers to extend HTML and HTML attributes with directives, special tokens in markup that indicate how the library should handle certain Document Object Model (DOM) elements. Directives can be built-in or user defined.

Vue is similar to React in purpose, but each have different pros and cons. Ease of integration is a common praise for Vue and a less strict learning curve is also a relevant bonus. Vue was created by one man named Evan You and has always been open-source, relying heavily on community support. He created Vue to combine features from already popular frameworks like React and Angular.

## MySQL

MySQL is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS) with a client-server model. RDBMS is a software or service used to create and manage databases based on a relational model. MySQL allow clients to connect to a server through a network. The client can make requests to the server using a graphical user interface (GUI). There are a lot of GUIs that support MySQL. Some of the most popular GUIs are MySQL WorkBench, SequelPro, DBVisualizer, and the Navicat DB Admin Tool.

Using a desired GUI the server, then, fulfills the request as long as both client-server understand the instruction. In simplified terms, MySQL  creates a database for storing and manipulating data then allows clients to use SQL statements to make requests allowing the server to provide the required information. The simplicity of MySQL makes it easy to use while offering high performance as it is able to tore wide array of data. In addition, MySQL has a high security level making it attractive to larger companies. The final link below gives an idea of some of the companies that use MySQL.

## WebAssembly
WebAssembly is an open standard that defines a portable binary code format for executable programs, and a corresponding textual assembly language, as well as interfaces for facilitating interactions between such programs and their host environment. The main goal of WebAssembly is to enable high performance applications on web pages, but the format is designed to be executed and integrated in other environments as well.
WebAssembly, or WASM for short. WebAssembly is a small, fast binary format that promises near-native performance for web applications. Plus, WebAssembly is designed to be a compilation target for any language, JavaScript being just one of them.

## Docker
Docker is a basic tool that allows you to control the application’s operating system by using containers. A container isolates or contains the code and operating systems of the applications. They keep everything organized as you can choose how to isolate the different apps. This enables you to run all of the containers on the same host, which makes it easy to run your software no matter where you are. A software called Kubernetes, made by Google, can help you manage all of your containers. Businesses use Docker to reduce inoperability of their systems and make it easier to move to different clouds when working with multiple vendors.

## Kubernetes / K8s
Kubernetes(K8s) is a container management PaaS(Platform as a Service). K8s uses what's called clusters which are
made up of virtual machines (VMs) that each do specific tasks as either a master or a node. These nodes is a host
for one or more containers. These containers contain applications and the master VM communicates with the nodes on
whether to create or destroy nodes or to reroute traffic between nodes. 

The reason to use Kubernetes is because it's faster than other methods, cheaper than other methods, 
and much more efficient than other methods. Kubernetes offers virtually infinite scalability and access anywhere
as either an on-premise, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure. The downside to K8s is that is requires other
projects to function at full efficiency. In order to take advantage of everything Kubernetes has to offer it needs:
- Registry
- Networking
- Telemetry
- Security
- Automation
- and other services dependant on the task at hand.

## Accessibility / A11y
A general definition of accessibility, or “A11y”, is a product or service that is obtainable easily. The term “A11y” was coined by The A11y Project to promote accessibility across websites. As technology expands, accessibility is very important because users need to have convenient access to things like websites, apps, etc. 

Another function of accessibility is the focus on treating people equally. Accessibility accommodates people with disabilities to have the same experience as everyone else. As a result, accessibility improves usability, avoids discrimination and legal complications, builds positive public relations, and creates a better search engine optimization (SEO).

## User Experience / Usability
User Experience refers to the design process. Usability plays a key role in improving UX. User Experience refers to a person’s feelings about using a particular product including functionality, branding, and comparisons to the psychological expectations. UX is based off of satisfaction, enjoyment, pleasure, and value it brings to a user. This is a broad and holistic view of a IT product or system.

Usability is a measurable indicator for IT systems and products. This refers to the degree of effectiveness, ease of use, and efficiency for the consumers. Usability includes effectiveness, efficiency, learnability, memorability, and error prevention. Usability is a more narrowed and focused aspect of UX. Usability is an important role in making a good UX; the easier and more effective an IT product or system is, the more pleasant experience a user will have, thus a higher UX.

## Nginx
NGINX is a new emerging web server that is becoming the most popular web server in the world. NGINX is a high performance web server, it outperforms apache when loading static web pages. It can be used as load balanceer, mail proxy, HTTP cache, web server, and a reverse proxy. NGINX was created as an open source project in 2004. NGINX is build on a programming language called C. Igor Sysoev was the original creator of NGINX, he wrote it to solve the C10K problem, this is a problem that still exists today, this problem is when web servers have trouble handling large numbers of concurrent users.

The main goal of NGINX was to create the fastest web server around and using this as the central goal of the project. NGINX is typically used as a load bolancer as well, which means NGINX can manage high volumes of traffic and distribute this traffic to optimize webserver clusters performance levels. It also is typically used as a reverse proxy, you can think of this as a proxy for servers, not clients. 

Here are some helpful websites that can provide furthur details and infomation about NGINX. <br />
