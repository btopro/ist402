## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## HTML
HTML, or "HyperText Markup Language", is a markup language used primarily for front-end web development.  It represents objects using tags, and allows programmers to instantiate objects thereby creating a document which is viewable through use of a web browser.  See the below links for some examples and further information.

## CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to manipulate the presentation of an HTML document. It is used to simplify the process of making web pages look presentable. It is used to define styles for web pages, including design, layout and variations in display for different screen sizes. Some advantages in using CSS are that it saves time, helps pages load faster, is easy to maintain, fits the global web standards, and has superior styles to HTML.

## Web Components
Web Components are web platform APIs things that allow you to create reusable custom elements in web pages and web apps. The three ones that are used together are Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and HTML templates. Web components help developers expand past the limits that browsers provide in existing HTML tags.

## Bash (sh)
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell.[12][13] First released in 1989,[14] it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions.[15] Bash was one of the first programs Linus Torvalds ported to Linux, alongside GCC.[16] A version is also available for Windows 10 via the Windows Subsystem for Linux.[17] It is also the default user shell in Solaris 11.[18] Bash was also the default shell in versions of Apple macOS from 10.3 (originally default shell was tcsh) to the 2019 release of macOS Catalina, which changed the default shell to zsh, although Bash remains available as an alternative shell.[19]   - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)

## Vue.js

Vue.js is a front end JavaScript framework used for building user applications and interfaces. Similar yet different from React and Angular, Vue can be used in conjunction with frameworks like Electron to build both web applications and mobile and desktop apps. With its main feature being incremental adoption, Vue is one of the most easily adoptable JavaScript frameworks, allowing you to slowly implement Vue into an existing project rather than having to implement it all at once. The one big drawback of Vue is that it remains exclusively focued on the view layer, meaning that to build functionality such as routing, build tooling, and state management, you need to use external supporting libraries and packages.
Vue.js is an open source framework/library that is primarily used for UI development and Design. Focused on the View Layer only hence the name.

## Python
Python is a high-level programming language that was released in 1991.  It has become increasingly popular among developers, due to its usability and general ease (expressing concepts is so much easier than Java, C++ or C).

  Here is a fun fact:
    -the name inspiration came from the BBC tv show "Monty Python's Flying Circus" (IMO it should be from Monty        Python and the Holy Grail)

## Accessibility / A11y

Very important with front-end web development. It is essential to ensure that websites are accessible for those who are disabled (could be colorblindness, hearing issues, etc). Web developers have to take disabilities into account. There are tools to help developers see where accessibility is lacking in their apps.
