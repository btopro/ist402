## Front end Developer
A front end developer works on "front end" code in an application, commonly meaning the code that customers and product users interact with directly. A "front end dev" will typically write CSS, HTML and JavaScript in order to build complex interfaces for people to use. The front end development stack is always changing but tends to involve a front end library like Angular, React, Vue or Web components and a lot of backend knowledge in "tooling" like yarn / npm.

## WordPress CMS
A Content Management System (CMS) is a type of software that helps users in managing and creating digital content. WordPress is an open-source CMS-based system that allows users to create customized blogs and websites. Being an open-source platform, WordPress has a multitude of developers that constantly update and add new features for free. Sites can be hosted on the WordPress server, or can be downloaded onto personal web hosts. 

The level of customization is what makes the platform so sucessful. Users can design a site using preinstalled themes and templates (no programming experience required), or create a site from scratch using PHP on a Linux or Windows OS. A vast amount of plugins can be installed into a WordPress site, such as SEO tools, security features, eCommerce solutions, among many others.

## Vue.js

Vue.js (pronounced the same as ‘view’) is a progressive Javascript framework used for developing user interfaces. Designed to be adoptable, Vue's basics are relatively easy to understand and can easily be integrated into existing projects and libraries. Vue enables developers to extend HTML and HTML attributes with directives, special tokens in markup that indicate how the library should handle certain Document Object Model (DOM) elements. Directives can be built-in or user defined.

Vue is similar to React in purpose, but each have different pros and cons. Ease of integration is a common praise for Vue and a less strict learning curve is also a relevant bonus. Vue was created by one man named Evan You and has always been open-source, relying heavily on community support. He created Vue to combine features from already popular frameworks like React and Angular.
