      <title>Class time together</title>
      <link>/class-time-together</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>We're going to strive for this general flow to each week of the semester. A few specific topics will deviate and we may have some guest speakers, but generally this is what class will look like together</p>
<ul><li>Capability / skill / technology of the day with quick discussion of what people think that's for, or places they've heard of it previously</li>
<li>A brief lecture (25 - 30 min) about the skill, who uses it, and how it's put into practice. This is taking the concept into the theory realm.</li>
<li>Screw theory, we're only going to learn by getting our hands dirty! We'll take a quick break to prep the keyboards. (10 min for questions, 5 min break)</li>
<li>Next we'll all follow along doing a very basic example of the skill. This might be running commands in a terminal or hooking up a new IFTTT command to Github via the UI. Something that's all of us following along and doing it together, stopping to answer any questions along the way.</li>
<li>The rest of the time from here is open lab. We'll have a lab with a few options for experiencing and implementing the skill in practice.</li>
<li>What ever you don't get done in class is to be completed after class but we'll always start on the work together in case there are issues.</li>
</ul>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>In all the technologies and skillsets we'll explore in this course, I want you to approach them with the same questions that I have explored in my career. These simple questions will help you decipher what's going to get you the furthest for the longest.</p>
<p>Technological sustainability is not easy; both in remaining relevant by sustaining your own skills as well as the sustained use of any solution by anyone or their organization.</p>
<p>What problem does this solve?</p>
<p>Who built this?</p>
<p>Where is this being used?</p>
<p>How can I go about using it?</p>
<p>Why do people use this over alternatives? (and what are the top 3 alternatives)</p>
<p>With each problem / solution space we look at in this course we're going to look at it through the lens of these questions.</p>

          <![CDATA[ <p>It's not as scary as that title.</p>
<p>We'll be exploring lots of different technologies through labs. In order to give me a good sense of what everyone's past experience is with these technologies, please complete the very short anonymous skills survey.</p>
<p>You aren't judged on this or graded, it's just to help me know how best to pace the course so that we can make the best use of our time together.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/BpRv39fV5jZFMLg77">Open the above survey in a new window</a>

</p>
<p>This is just to help me get a sense of things everyone has had past experience with so I know what to focus on in what order and in how much depth. These labs are designed to give you working knowledge of all of the things listed and to be able to have a conversation with managers, hiring groups, and developers about the tools IT organizations / start ups need to utilize on a daily basis.</p>

<p>My name is Bryan Ollendyke and I've been <strike>living</strike>


 working at Penn State since 2007. I did my undergrad in IST and was able to get a job working in the College of Arts & Architecture's online learning unit (now called Office of Digital Learning).</p>
<p>In 2015 I completed my MS by studying the spread of an open source platform called Drupal. The theory I reasoned from my thesis is an effect I call Information Altruism -- Meaning that it isn't open source software that impacts institutions <b>but the free giving away of knowledge about how to use it</b>


 which does.</p>
<p>Open source lays the ground work, but it still requires knowledge workers to pick up those raw minerals and make rails of them for organizations to ride on.</p>
<p>I am in the rare position of getting to teach you leveraging tools which I and my team have built. This content is written in a platform called HAXcms which we are actively building. I'm also the project lead on a project called ELMS: Learning Network.</p>
<p>Since starting at Penn State, I would say 99.5% of every hour of every day I work is contributed directly back to open code and documentation. I've contributed hundreds of modules for Drupal, dozens of themes and installation profiles, millions of lines of code liberated from the ownership of anyone or anywhere.</p>
<p>In the last two years, our team has released north of 400 reusable design assets called Web components. These modules and design assets power thousands of websites and help empower people we'll never know to better express themselves online, whether for instructional content or otherwise.</p>
<p>I'm a self described Developer Activist in that I don't think open source can change society: I know it can and does constantly. It's why I still work in academia - to try and open source as much of the application stack associated with teaching and learning in order to provide both better options as well as lower costs.</p>

          <![CDATA[ <h2>IST 402: Emerging Technologies</h2>
<grid-plate layout="8/4" responsive-size="md" style="width: 100%;"><p slot="col-1">My name is Bryan Ollendyke, and welcome to IST 402: Emerging Tech!</p>







<p slot="col-1">I'm excited to expose you to the ideas and technologies I wish I had been exposed to when I was in IST. I graduated from IST in 2006 (and again in 2015), and while I took some programming focused courses in undergrad, it wasn't until I starting working on projects for the university that I had to learn on the job all aspects of real software development.</p>

<p slot="col-1">I am a unicorn in the industry. A unicorn is often known as a "Full Stack Developer". It's a thing that "doesn't exist" or isn't to be sought after. The market tends to force hyper specialization, front end, back end, sys ops, dev ops, css / designer as opposed to one person that can touch all aspects of the application. I've been collecting a mix of unicorns through my work at the university and would love to share our experiences with you and expose you to technologies we work on every day.</p>



<p slot="col-1">I love open source software, hockey, web technologies, Penn State, and meme's.... cause obviously. I present regularly at events around the country on web components, educational technology, NGDLE, and Drupal / PHP at both technical events and educator centric ones.</p>

<p slot="col-1">I walk between worlds and hope to provide you with a unique perspective in the process!</p>

<h2>Course description</h2>
<p>We're going to learn about and participate in open source software communities. We're going to use github to do this. We're going to make YouTube channels full of knowledge that you've assembled in this course, create social media posts promoting it and other projects you'll work on, and generally give you a sense of the skills required to get involved in start up culture.</p>
<p>We'll cover human things like workflow management, user experience, community building and accessibility.</p>
<p>We'll get into amazing web services like Stackblitz.io, CloudFlare, DigitalOcean, Github, IFTTT, TravisCI, Slack, talk about how they work, play with them, and blog about using them.</p>
<p>We'll cover technical concepts like Web components, version control (git), Content managment systems, "flat file" systems.</p>
<p>We'll get hands on and write markdown, yaml, json, web components (HTML/CSS/JS).</p>
<p>We'll "build servers" and make our own website to understand how all that works.</p>
<p>We'll generally remove the magic that divides consumers from producers in the digital realm and get you a step closer being involved in a start up.</p>
<p>The vast majority of your work will be done out in the open to help you build an identity as an IT professional and someone that has the right accounts and is active with them come interview time or where ever you find yourself after this place.</p>
<p>My goals for this course are to get you more comfortable with these tools, build your online personal / brand, and hopefully get you commits to real world open source projects.</p>

<h2>(Boring) "Blue Book" description from {<i>terrible</i>
} LionPath</h2>
<h3>Start up? Let's Tool up!</h3>
<p>The "Start up" culture is a world that lives by "move fast and break things". But how do you get into the start up scene? Or more importantly, what do you need to know in order to attract offers, and get your resume to stand out in a world where thousands of "IT workers" will graduate along side you.</p>
<p>You'll contribute to a large Penn State lead Open Source software project while building your digital identity as an IT professional on your journey to 1337 (elite). You'll improve online education while using things like version control (git), docker, web components, terminal, servers, screencasting and writing technical documentation.</p>
<p>You'll work with platforms like Github, Digital Ocean, HAXcms, IFTTT, Slack, Travis CI and YouTube. Prior programming knowledge is beneficial but understanding of technical concepts is more important.</p>
