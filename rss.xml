.</p>
<p>Containers are transforming the landscape of the web and what's possible in application development at scale. Companies like Google, Netflix, Uber, Canvas and more are only possible because of the raw power of container and container orchestration technology.</p>
<p>This week we'll explore containers using the web service <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">Play with Docker</a>
, a great resource that gives you infrastructure for 4 hours at a time without needing to pay anything.</p>
<p>Our guest speaker, former Penn State graduate <a href="https://twitter.com/hey__mp">Michael Potter</a>
 will show us many different use cases for containers using <a href="https://docker.com">Docker</a>
. He'll give you a behind the scenes look at the container infrastructure he's building to deliver high quality online course experiences at Eberly College of Science using an advanced container publishing workflow.</p>

      <title>Lab 13 - Docker</title>
      <link>/labs/lab-13-docker</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>For lab this week, we'll use directions our guest has put together to deploy different services via docker to better understand Functions as a Service technology as well as a bit of how docker infrastructure works.</p>
<h2>Setting up Ubuntu</h2>
<p>We'll do this in class using <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">Play with Docker</a>
.</p>
<h2>HAXcms</h2>
<p>We'll do this in class together. Let's <a href="https://github.com/heyMP/ist402-docker/tree/master/haxcms">setup HAXcms</a>
 in Play with Docker. This will most likely have trouble getting past the install screen but it's good practice to demonstrate in the context of something we can all visualize and have worked with.</p>
<h2>OpenFaaS</h2>
<p>OpenFaaS is an open source functions as a service platform for building your own function based microservice endpoints. <a href="https://github.com/heyMP/ist402-docker/tree/master/openfaas">Follow the directions in this repo</a>
 to setup OpenFaaS on <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">Play with Docker</a>
.</p>
<h2>Deliverable</h2>
<p>This week I want you to try your hand at the following (or combinations in the video).</p>
<ul><li>Install OpenFaaS in Play with Docker and explain why functions as a service are the future of infrastructure. This could be done showing one of the functions we covered in class and relating it to how Uber spins up a service to track your location and relay it to the drive (as one example).</li>
<li>Find a diagram to explain Docker and the difference between it and Virtual Machine technology, explaining why containers are the future of technology backed businesses. Install HAXcms in Play with Docker and get it to the install screen. (It has issues at times getting past this phase as this is just a demo)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>Add your video to the <b>#lab13-docker</b>
 slack channel.</p>
<h2>Evaluation rubric</h2>
<ul><li>Did you demonstrate installing either application in Play with Docker? <b>(5pts)</b>
</li>
<li>Did you explain the difference between Containers and Virtual Machines or what Functions as a Service is with examples? <b>(4pts)</b>
</li>
<li>Did you submit your video to the channel? <b>(1pt)</b>
</li>
</ul>

      <title>Lab 12 - Accessible Design</title>
      <link>/labs/lab-12-accessible-design</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>You live in the world of Stranger Things. I know, it's hard to envision, it's why it's such a good show. Old people like your instructor, actually remember parts of the 80s and what it was like to not know where people were at all times.</p>
<grid-plate style="width: 100%;" breakpoint-sm="900" breakpoint-md="1200" breakpoint-lg="1500" breakpoint-xl="1800" layout="1-1" responsive-size="xl">  <p slot="col-1">Anyway. A lost art from the 80s was designing for interfaces that were primitive. Often times years would be lost trying to design simple things like joysticks and monitors to present primitive games with only a few options. But, these systems are universally approachable and the constrains put on the technology of the day helped inform this.</p>
  <meme-maker slot="col-2" alt="home video running GIF" image-url="https://media3.giphy.com/media/Z71HSa4vBWlW/giphy.gif" top-text="1 stick, no btnz" bottom-text="best game evrz" imageurl="https://media3.giphy.com/media/Z71HSa4vBWlW/giphy.gif" toptext="home video running GIF" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></meme-maker>
</grid-plate>
<p>Now we live in a world without constraints which often leads to less accessible, less usable experiences. That's where you come in...</p>
<p>Today, we're going to design an interface or interaction that would be heavily steeped in constraints in order to envision more accessible systems. Take an application like twitter, remove the screen, the auto updating and self refreshing interfaces, remove the trolling and memes; how would people be able to leverage twitter effectively. What prompts would make sense on a command line, or on a simple 1999 style website (text box, click to submit data, that's about it).</p>
<p>Twitter is too easy an example which is why I'm spelling it out here: that's because the 140 character limit previously on twitter was because it was envisioned as a way of initially bridging cellphones to contribute to the web. People would "log into twitter" by texting a special number and that text === tweet. Laughable to think about now, but it was the original design and simplicity that was possible via constraint based design.</p>
<h2>Now it's your turn</h2>
<p>Think of an interface you use (inventory management in a game, registering for a course, shopping online).</p>
<p>Now imagine that interface existed as a text-based computer program from the <b>1980s</b>
. How would you communicate visual elements and order items logically? The text-based story to make the initial design.  This will help you think about screen readers first.</p>
<p>Now imagine that the interface existing in the early <b>1990s</b>
 as only HTML. What HTML elements would you need? This will help you think about progressive enhancement (and making sites work without too much javascript).</p>
<p>Make a video explaining how an interface of your choice would look in 1980 and in 1990 and what aspects should carry forward to the modern web.</p>
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXA2lepIpHZ24iQU22WgDeA">Squirrel Monkey YouTube Channel</a>
</p>
<video-player iframed="iframed" is-a11y-media="is-a11y-media" is-youtube="is-youtube" lang="en" media-title="What if Dropbox existed in the 80s" preload="metadata" source="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hu87s_BA7_Y" source-type="youtube" sticky-corner="top-right" youtube-id="hu87s_BA7_Y" schema-resource-id="#4bc09838-e59e-6789-8a79" resource="#4bc09838-e59e-6789-8a79" prefix="oer:http://oerschema.org/ schema:http://schema.org/ dc:http://purl.org/dc/terms/ foaf:http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ cc:http://creativecommons.org/ns# bib:http://bib.schema.org " accent-color="grey" style="width: 75%;" sources="[]" tracks="[]"></video-player>
<h2>Deliverable</h2>
<p>Using your HAXcms site, create a page named for the technology / interface you are going to imagine in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>Write a paragraph about the technology / link to media associated with it so everyone knows exactly what it is. Then write a paragraph about the key features that would translate to 80s technology and write a paragraph about the key features you would visualize in the 90s / basic html based web.</p>
<p>Record a 5 minute video explaining the technology and limiting factors that would need to be replicated in an 80s and 90s context. This could be done talking over very rough mock ups / user flow diagrams in draw.io or with fun memes / related concepts like the Squirrel Monkey folks do.</p>
<p>Embed this / add a link to your HAXcms page and then submit it to the <b>#lab12-a11y-design</b>
 channel in Slack.</p>
<h2>Rubric</h2>
<p>Did you pick a technology to bring to a 80s/90s concept and submit to the channel? (2pts)</p>
<p>Does your written user story make sense? (4pts)</p>
<p>Did you explain how this would work effectively in your video? (4pts)</p>

      <link>/labs/lab-11-accessibility</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>Web accessibility is just one piece of the accessibility pie but we're attuned to its importance. The next thing though is how do we use tools to help build more accessible things and remediate what we already have?</p>
<h2>Prelab / in class doing</h2>
<p>Let's install the <b>WAVE Evaluation Tool</b>
 and <b>Lighthouse</b>
 plugins for Chrome / Firefox.</p>
<p>Let's work through some accessibility issues in a code pen to get some basics down</p>
<p>Codepen: <a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/a11y-issues?file=index.html" style="font-family: var(--haxcms-base-styles-body-font-family, &quot;Noto Serif&quot;, serif); letter-spacing: var(--haxcms-base-styles-body-letter-spacing, 0.5px);">https://stackblitz.com/edit/a11y-issues?file=index.html</a>
</p>
<p>Let's check out these websites and read through the <b>Lighthouse score and WAVE </b>
to understand issues and see what real reports look and feel like</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://revenuedata.doi.gov/">https://revenuedata.doi.gov/</a>

<h2>Lab Scenario</h2>
<p>You are a consultant bring brought in to help out a web team organized by someone with <b>your exact name</b>
, that has a site builder with <b>the same name</b>
, and oddly a developer also with... the <b>same name</b>
 (weird..)! You work at A11y for All inc (great company name...) and you are here because of concerns by the web team that past projects were not correctly audited for performance and accessibility.<span> (WTF?! WHY DIDN'T THE INSTRUCTOR TELL US TO AUDIT OUR STUFF ALONG THE WAY).</span></p>
<p>Your CEO, Admiral Akbar is <i><b>piiiiiiiiiiiist</b>
</i>
</p>
<meme-maker alt="its a trap GIF by Star Wars" image-url="https://media3.giphy.com/media/3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac/giphy.gif" top-text="No audits?" imageurl="https://media3.giphy.com/media/3ornka9rAaKRA2Rkac/giphy.gif" toptext="its a trap GIF by Star Wars" style="width: 75%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></meme-maker>
<p>"It's ok though CEO Akbar", you assure the CEO, "you're paying our exorbitant rates to solve this problem for you. We'll even teach your team how to solve these problems to avoid issues in the future!"</p>

<h2>Lab what to do</h2>
<ul><li>Audit any of the past CMS projects using <b>Lighthouse</b>
 and <b>WAVE</b>
</li>
<li>If there's anything simple in content that you can fix, remediate it, but the goal here is understanding how to interpret the reports and explain how the problems found can be remediated.</li>
<li>Use your past HAXcms site to add a page of content with screenshots of your lighthouse scores</li>
<li>On that page, put your video explaining the following..</li>
</ul>
<h2>Video what to cover</h2>
<p>For your video I want you to <b>explain how you ran an accessibility and performance audit of a website</b>
. This can be one of the websites your worked on in class OR (and probably more meaningful) perform this audit on a club, organization or other website that's associated with you or that you can actually have an impact on by running this audit and providing feedback.</p>
<p>Make sure to explain what the audit is, why it's important, and then a bit about how the site can leverage the scores to make improvements. Don't just say "it needs to improve accessibility" take at least one of the points and explain what a remediation would look like in order to improve. This can be from the WAVE or Lighthouse feedback.</p>
<h2>Submission Rubric</h2>
<p>Ran reports and posted screenshots to HAXcms site <b>(4 pts)</b>
</p>
<p>Recorded a video accurately explaining what the reports generate and how they are useful <b>(6 pts)</b>
</p>
<p><b>10 point lab</b>
</p>
<p>Post link to page in HAXcms site with the video included in<b> #lab11-accessibility</b>

      <title>Lab 9 - Drupal again</title>
      <link>/labs/lab-9-drupal-again</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>Drupal was both challenging and many wanted to learn more. As it's a much more complex system then the other CMSs we're covering, we're going to dedicate an additional class period JUST to doing more with Drupal.</p>
<p>For this lab we're going for technique and comprehension of what's happening with Drupal and in a use-case that's treating our website like an API.</p>
<p>We're going to build on the last lab where we started making a course schedule. Let's imagine that we're building a course scheduling system that is actually usable by humans (stretching your imagination, I know but stick with me, it's possible).</p>
<h2>Lab Context <span>(purely hypothetical, NEVER happened before)</span></h2>
<p>In an alternative universe, you are the <b>site builder</b>
 that convinced the team <b>they COULD do</b>
 projects with Drupal. Even though you work for a marketing firm, your CEO enjoys money and hears higher education clients have a lot of it. Now that they <b><i>know</i>
 based on 1 week experience</b>
 that you can pull off complex technical projects in the "market vertical" and respond to an RFP from a large land grant university to redo their course scheduling system called "PionLath".</p>
<p>"PionLath" has been an utter UX disaster.<b> It doesn't model user roles </b>
correctly of the organization and has poor permission support within those roles. It also doesn't allow for <b>web services and APIs</b>
 to get data back out of it in new and meaningful ways. The university wants to get data out in a format that can be displayed on signage around the university but also just to ensure they aren't locked into the horrific UX patterns they currently experience with "PionLath".</p>
<p>They are looking for a solution that is cost effective given the multiple-millions of dollars spent on "PionLath" and the relative dislike of it by uhh... everyone. (again, totally hypothetical, this really isn't a problem that's ever happened at a <b>large land grant institution</b>
)</p>
<p>You easily win the bid because you've got a fantastic proposal writer, a cool sounding company and use words in marketing like "leader" and "synergy" and now you're ready to dig your claws into..err... help empower this large land grant institution.</p>
<h2>Synergistically doing more Leader'ing with Drupal</h2>
<p>Here's what we need to do this week and will walk through together in class. We need to:</p>
<ul><li>Create roles for Instructor, Parent, Student, Administrator</li>
<li>Change permissions for Instructors to be able to create new courses</li>
<li>Create an entity reference field between the course and the room and the instructor correctly</li>
<li>Fix any relationship data between courses, rooms and instructors now that we have a "reference" field that can help us relate the data together!</li>
<li>Add an image field to our <b>course</b>
 to better market it</li>
<li>Enable these modules: Update Manager, HTTP Basic Authentication, JSON:API, RESTful Web Services, Serialization</li>
<li>Click "Install new Module" or go to the path <b>admin/modules/install</b>
</li>
<li>Install the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/cors">CORS module for Drupal</a>
 - by copy and pasting this https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/cors-8.x-1.0.tar.gz</li>
<li>Enable the CORS module</li>
<li>Go to the CORS settings page (admin/config/services/cors) and make sure that it says the following value: *|*</li>
<li>Clear caches (a common operation in drupal for things like this) admin/config/development/performance and hit clear cache</li>
<li>Here's a resource for all things Drupal + JSONAPI as far as how to construct paths for reference: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/jsonapi/fetching-resources-get">https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/modules/jsonapi/fetching-resources-get</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Your site will now work with Web services! Now let's dig in and test the info some:</span><br/></p>
<h2><span>Get the tools to start digging into this and implementing the API</span></h2>
<p><span><a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">https://www.getpostman.com</a>

<p><font face="Space Mono">No writing this week, only technique.</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Space Mono">Add the roles in question above and enable the correct modules so that if I go to YOURSITENAME.COM/DRUPALWHATEVER/jsonapi that it shows me the correct output.</font>
</p>
<h2><span><span>Video based deliverable (one of these or a related method)</span></span></h2>
<p><span><span>Do a video explaining how this little API example is working by interacting with it in the video and explaining how the code pen and the website are communicating either using Postman to visualize or the data in the pen itself. Change the data / add records in the Drupal site in order to demonstrate that when you reload the pen they show up.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do a video explaining the value of "headless" and API driven example using this and any articles you find as examples. Why are API driven applications better than monolithic designed systems?
</span></span></p>
<p><font face="Space Mono">Do a video about CORS and the security implications of headless based development methods. What is CORS? Why is it important? When does it get triggered?</font>
</p>
<h2><font face="Space Mono">Method of delivery</font>

<h2>Lab scenario driven submissions and videos</h2>
<meme-maker alt="high school GIF" image-url="https://media2.giphy.com/media/8RczH5vL2k7Ju/giphy.gif" top-text="LETS ALL GO TO HAXCMS" imageurl="https://media2.giphy.com/media/8RczH5vL2k7Ju/giphy.gif" toptext="high school GIF" style="width: 50%; margin: 0px auto; display: block;"></meme-maker>
<p><i>You may complete this either using <a href="https://hax.psu.edu/login">hax.psu.edu</a>
 or Reclaim Hosting. Both work.</i>
</p>
<p>HAXcms is a highly flexible, organic static site solution. Because this is a new breed of authoring experience, it needs explaining and people to utilize the tool in different contexts to fully realize it's potential.</p>
<p>As HAX and HAXcms are being developed by the university to improve time on task, increase creativity in course design and help students present themselves online, you can complete this through any of the following scenarios.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>Scenario: "Online course"</b>
</h2>
<p>Instructors don't want to learn new technologies that might get in the way of teaching. They want platforms that are simple to use, recognizable, and that will last. They've seen the ages of LMSs and having to port content to and from wordpress / other CMS solutions in the past. As a result, they need reassurance that HAXcms is easy to use and that it'll be an engaging way for them to teach.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this assignment, we'll take "engaging" to mean funny. So make sure there's lots of memes and fun things in what you're about to develop here. There are a few themes that make sense for presenting an online course but your welcome to use which ever theme you'd like.</p>
<p>Create a short ~ <b>10-20 page online course</b>
 about anything you want to teach a friend or family member about. It could be one of the topics from our course or something that you know more about than anyone else.</p>
<h3>Possible topics:</h3>
<ul><li>One of the CMSs we've covered</li>
<li>The history of the game of hockey</li>
<li>Big 10 university mascots</li>
<li>Top 10 interesting technologies to you</li>
<li>Literally anything. Just fill the content with memes, videos, wikipedia articles, anything that makes it more engaging</li>
<li>Anything personal to you, literally. Just as long as you connect with the material that you want to build into a learning resource for someone else.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Video submission</h2>
<p>Your video could be about any of the following in the HAX universe. The point is to generate content that is relevant in "selling" this new technology to a stakeholder group. Any of these are possible submissions</p>
<ul><li><b>Sustainability</b>
 - that all content is in Web components and lives on beyond any one fad or system. Sell a CIO on the long term cost reduction associated with this platform as well as the ability to be portable in migrating content between systems because its less platform locked.</li>
<li><b>Multi-CMS</b>
 - HAX can be leveraged in Drupal, WordPress, GravCMS (you could even show how to install it in these..). Demonstrate HAX running in another platform and submit a video about your experience involved in that process. If it makes sense, if you couldn't get it working and what was confusing, are all valid and important outcomes.</li>
<li><b>Your Experience</b>
 - Describe your frustrations in using HAX and HAXcms. What made sense immediately? What took some time to figure out? What's something that worked really well? What's something that still doesn't make sense to you?</li>
</ul>
<p>
What didn't work or what you ran into issues using the platform are critical to our team getting user feedback and improving.<br/></p>
<h2>Submitting this Lab</h2>
<p>Embed your YouTube video on the homepage of your HAXcms site.</p>
<p>Submit a link to your HAXcms site to <b>#lab10-haxtheweb</b>
</p>
<h2><b>Grading the Lab</b>
</h2>
<p>Did you create a site using HAXcms and post your link to the channel<b> (2pts)</b>
</p>
<p>Did you create a fun site that teaches someone about a topic you are passionate about? <b>(4pts)</b>
</p>
<p>Did you record a video that makes the case for HAXcms, show how to setup HAX in another platform, or unpack and explain your experience (POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE) in using the platform? <b>(4pts)</b>
</p>
<p><b>Special note</b>
: You will not be evaluated based on your opinion of the platform. If you have a horrible experience or don't like it or something is difficult, be honest. We grow from critique far more then fake-positive reviews. You are evaluated based on GIVING AN OPINION and backing it up :)</p>

      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <h3>Data modeling</h3>
<p>This is to be done in class with image posted here for reference but in case you miss the activity that generates it. <span>Take 10-15 minutes and figure out the fields and relationships of this data:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="files/Untitled Diagram (1).jpg">Here's the diagram we came up with.</a>
</span></p>
<img src="files/Untitled Diagram (1).jpg" alt="data model" style="width: 100%;"/><ul><li><b>Courses</b>
</li>
<ul><li>{come up with the relationships}</li>
<li><span>{come up with the fields}</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span><b>Faculty</b>
</span></li>

<li><span>Use a “Relationship” in the view in order to show the courses that faculty members are teaching and make this the focus of your video</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Submitting the Lab</h2>
<ul><li>Create your Drupal site building out the view and content types that we chose to model our data off of this week</li>

          <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/btopro/drupal-180769121">Slides for this topic</a>
</p>
<p>Drupal is the worlds most powerful, most complex and as a result, the most expensive CMS. We'll explore Drupal's concepts and do some data modeling together in class. Then we'll use Drupal to model those relationships in the website.</p>
<p>We'll learn about Content Types and fields to model data. Then we'll use Views in order to visualize that data and work with content entry to make sense of it all.</p>
<p>Drupal is daunting at first but once you learn the concepts and experience them they form a repeatable pattern of development and site building that leads you into a large community with lots of financial opportunities.</p>

 is also concerned about this "New Editor" they keep hearing about. Some want to try it out, others like things the way it is now because of training.</li>






<li><b><a href="labs/lab-6-wordpress/scenario-2">Client 2</a>

</b>


 is questioning why you selected Grav for their project and wants you to review if they should be using WordPress because of other projects they are using it on.</li>

          <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/btopro/classicpress-wordpress-180769120">Lecture slides from this week</a>
</p>
<p>This week we'll be covering WordPress, the worlds most widely used open source CMS. WordPress is great for simple websites of which the web is made up of many. It's why it powers (estimates, numbers differ by source) 33% to as much as 50% of sites on the internet.</p>
<p>These sites could be everything from the Whitehouse down to every individual blog / new acount on wordpress.com (SaaS solution version) which is why people take some of that number with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>It's a great platform to start your own website on but it's run into some recent controversies which are worth exploring - namely the battle for the heart of the community around a text editor. It's weird to think about, but when a CMS lives and dies by the ease of content entry, you can understand why the <b>new core mandatory</b>
 text editor called<b> Gutenberg</b>
 would attract positive and negative attention.</p>
<p>With plans to phase out the "Classic Editor" in 2020 many people in the community are at a cross-roads: Continue to trust the same core community that "took away" their beloved simple HTML editor, or forge a new path. We'll look briefly at the concept of community forks through the context of ClassicPress, a popular WordPress alternative that's gaining traction as the more community centric CMS.</p>
<p>With parallels to Drupal and it's popular fork Backdrop (topic for next lab) we'll see that it's not always code that leads to inflection points in groups but the process by which that code is formed, agreed upon, and ultimately pushed into the main project everyone's aligned with.</p>
<p>WordPress is a great resume builder both in terms of the platform as well as putting on your resume that you have experience with it, so let's dig in and check it out in <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">ReclaimHosting</a>
 once more!</p>

          <![CDATA[ <p>See slides from <a href="topics/drupal">topic 7 on Drupal</a>
. There are several examples with answers in the front of the slide deck you can use to review the types of questions you'll be asked.</p>
<p>This is an "open web" review. The real world you can google things if you get stuck and this is no different. Now, you can't take credit for other people's work in my class or IRL, so the TA will be proctoring this exam and ensuring that everyone's responsible for their own work.</p>
<p>After the exam please answer the course survey questions to give us feedback on how class has done so far and where to go.</p>

          <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://www.slideshare.net/btopro/grav-cms">Slides about CPanel & GravCMS from class</a>
</p>
<p>This week kicks off <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim hosting</a>
 and our Content Management System section of the course. We're going to be covering four different content management systems in this section of the course leveraging <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/">Reclaim hosting</a>
 to skip a lot of the tediousness of setting up and playing with a CMS.</p>
<p>We'll talk about CPanel in the high level as far as what function it provides and navigate some of the parts of it a bit, though it won't be the focus. CPanel has been around forever (in web terms) and is still a powerful way to abstract away the complexity of managing servers and get you access to installing apps via a nice UI and mild technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Listing CMS "Site building" skills on a resume is a sure fire way to get noticed by certain companies looking for people who can hit the ground running with their internal systems. It demonstrates that you know how to navigate technical systems and can be taught out to administer them (potentially).</p>
<p>It's also a bit crazy as CMSs really are just big storage houses of information with text editors and other UIs that help streamline getting large groups of media and content on the web. The crazy part is, this really isn't that hard to do (as we'll demonstrate through these units) but a lot of people are so afraid of them that they won't touch them.</p>
<p>Master any one of these popular CMSs coming up (especially Drupal coming up) and you'll stand out in any organization that manages web projects or interfaces regularly with the web properties of the company directly.</p>

          <![CDATA[ <p>Slides - <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/btopro/web-components-and-package-managers">Web components & Package managers</a>
</p>
<p>Web components are the future of web development. Combined with package management systems like npm, they empower teams to leverage the work of others in a sustainable, secure and accessible manner.</p>
<p>This week is mostly in slide form as a result of the many talks that btopro gives on these topics. This course is built out of web components and increasingly everything from signs at fast food restaurants to websites you use ever day (like YouTube) will be built out of web components.</p>

      <title>Lab 4 - Webcomponents</title>
      <link>/labs/webcomponents-1</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <p>For this lab we're going to look at a few different services that are like codepen but allow for more advanced use-cases and development to support web components (and other front end languages).</p>
<h3>Exercises</h3>
<p>We're going to look at some different examples in different platforms that are similar to codepen but I also wanted to point out this really slick, business use-case demo from a popular web components company named Vaadin: <a href="https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/">https://demo.vaadin.com/customer-crud-app/</a>
</p>
<p><b>Glitch.com</b>

 - A basic example of referencing and leveraging existing web components to do small things and insane things. Buttons, calendars, or... 3d model viewing???</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://glitch.com/~ui5-webcomponents">https://glitch.com/~ui5-webcomponents</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/wcp-model-viewer?path=index.html:27:28">https://glitch.com/edit/#!/wcp-model-viewer?path=index.html:27:28</a>
<br/></li>

</ul>
<p><b>Stackblitz.com</b>

 - An example of three different web component libraries achieving the same result through similar syntax: 
<a href="https://stackblitz.com/edit/govsummit">https://stackblitz.com/edit/govsummit</a>

</p>
<p><b>Webcomponents.dev</b>

 - A Headless web application example:

</p>
<h3>How to submit to lab</h3>
<p>Similar to last week, we're going to fork and modify something but then we have a specific type of topic prompt for the response:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://webcomponents.dev/edit/KaQ3RE2hDjqwG48OPrnL">Fork this repo just like we did last week</a>
</li>
  <li>Update the details in <b>example-app</b>
 to relate to you</li>
  <li>Copy the <b>example-app</b>
 code and fill it out differently, demonstrating stacking / time savings</li>
  <li>update the CSS code to <b>remove the yellow background </b>
and<b> change the border color</b>
 of the css, impacting all copies (again, scale)</li>
  <li>Do your written response where it says "<i>Here's where you should fill in your response</i>
"</li>
<li>Pick <b>one of these </b>
to frame your writing and video response:	
    <ul>
    	<li>Make the <i>business</i>
, <i>security</i>
, <i>accessibility,</i>
 OR <i>design</i>
 case for using web components, leveraging links to support your case or through demonstration in one of the repos we've stepped through.</li>
      	<li><i>Code / Developer route</i>
: Run through <a href="https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/try">Try LitElement</a>
 and do a video explaining the value of LitElement, with supporting links.</li>
<li><i>Package manager / tooling pro</i>
: Setup NPM / node and create an element using Open-WC, the tooling the pros use <a href="https://open-wc.org/guide/">https://open-wc.org/guide/</a>
 and do a video on that process / making a hello-world element in it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Record your video and link to it from your fork of the repo next to the writing area</li>
<li>Post in <b>#lab-4-webcomponents</b>
 in our slack group</li>
<li><a href="https://reclaimhosting.com">Purchase a domain / account on Reclaim hosting to prepare for next week</a>
</li>
</ol>

      <title>Lab 3 - HTML / CSS / JS Web basics</title>
      <link>/labs/html-css-js-web-basics</link>
      <description>
          <![CDATA[ <h3>Lab 3</h3>
<p>For this lab we're going to be modifying three CodePens. The first one we'll do together in class for practice and getting a feel for HTML / CSS. JavaScript will come up again in the future so we'll keep the JS brief for this one.</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/zYOWqKZ">Exercise Pen</a>
: <span>Fork this Pen and we can follow along together in class.</span></p>
<h2>Lab Pen</h2>
<p>For this lab, I want you to modify <b>one of these</b>
 <b>pens</b>
 in order to make the resume reflect your own information. There's a <i>beginner Pen</i>
 and a more <i>advanced pen</i>
.</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/GRKQVBx?editors=1000">Beginner Pen</a>
: Personal Resume which contains hints and directions inside</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/GRKxKgX?editors=1000">Advanced Pen</a>
: no instructions and a slightly more advanced design. Use this to challenge yourself or if you've previously written HTML to make something more useful.</p>
<h3>Reflection Pen</h3>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/KKPozvd">FORK THIS PEN</a>
: For reflection this week I want you to fork this pen and write your response using HTML. For the topic this week pick one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Explaining how to apply styling to an element in <b>CSS</b>
</li>
<li>Explain how to use JavaScript and <b>getElementById</b>
 to add a <i>click event to</i>
 an element in an existing codepen that generates an alert saying <b>Hello</b>
</li>
<li><i>Value of CodePen as a platform</i>
 to learn coding by finding an inspiring pen and explain what's going on.</li>
</ul>
