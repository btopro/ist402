<p>My primary goal for you is to learn new things about modern web technologies while getting hands on with them. More specifically...</p>
<ul><li>Learning not just what a technology is but...</li>

<ul><li>Who's using it, what industries, what web services</li>

<li>Getting hands on and implementing it small scale</li>

<li>Being able to better communicate purpose and ideas around it</li>

</ul>


<li>Building a digital footprint of YOU, the IT worker / manager / developer / whatever your path, just that it's out there!</li>

<ul><li>Creating a YouTube channel of explainer videos about the topics discussed in class</li>

<li>Creating a Blog about these same topics</li>

<li>Creating social coder accounts and connecting them all together (like Github, TravisCI, Stackblitz, CodePen, Glitch, IFTTT, etc)</li>

</ul>

<li>Learn about all levels of "the stack" in order to better empathize with those working in different levels of the stack from you (or people you'll one day manage)</li>

<li>Have a website on the internet that you control and have a window into how all aspects of it function.</li>
<li><i>Take hand written tests</i>
 and <i>use platforms and technologies that no employer on earth will care about</i>
 once you graduate</li>

</ul>
