<p><span>We've talked about git for version control and explored Github a bit and how teams work together using the platform. Now let's dig in!</span><br/></p>
<h3 id="header-b818e0ae-3747-1061-bade-b8b5cfc9f94c">Basic example / Getting started</h3>
<ol><li>Create a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub account</a>
</li>
<li>Star the <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms">haxcms</a>
, <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/wcfactory">wcfactory</a>
 and <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents">LRNWebcomponents</a>
 repos, we will go back to the in the future and if you code you may be interested in them currently. (this is what we work on Wed, 9-12 at Starbucks on Calder if you want a deep dive in web development)</li>
<li>Our course is also powered by Git and on Github, so let's <a href="https://github.com/btopro/ist402">fork the repo backing this course</a>
</li>
<li>Go to <b>files/spring2020.md</b>
 and edit the file by clicking the pencil</li>
<li>Write markdown that adds the name of your brand and a link to your YouTube channel</li>
<li>Add a commit message saying that you added your link and hit Commit</li>
<li>Click <b>Pull Request</b>
 and create a new pull request</li>
<li>In the message for it indicate that you added the link to your channel and submit the PR.</li>
<li>We'll do this in class and look at the graph it forms</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="header-97dc74c8-1939-c146-a51f-14ec84a42e13"><span>Contributing to projects</span></h2>
<p><span>EVERYONE (me included) start out getting into a development community by updating documentation, making sure acronyms made sense and fixing links and typos. The best way to get into a software community is to fix things around the edges and ensure that you can effectively communicate with people in the project. It also helps prove they are human.</span></p>
<p><span>For the lab this week let's build a living glossary of the terms and technologies we're going to cover this semester and then use the standard way of contributing to projects in order to contribute back to the course.</span></p>
<ol><li>Go to the course repo and see the <a href="https://github.com/btopro/ist402/blob/master/files/glossary.md">files/glossary.md</a>
 file. This is the file that's powering the content in the Additional resources / Glossary portion of the course website</li>
<li>Look through the listed and claim a term that you are going to contribute a definition for.</li>
<li>How to claim a term:</li>
<ol><li><a href="https://github.com/btopro/ist402/issues">Go to the issue queue for the course</a>
</li>
<li>Pick a word you want to write a definition for and then respond in the issue queue claiming it</li>
<li>There are more terms than classmates so once one is claimed via issue it is taken</li>
</ol>
<li><span>Do some research to come up with a working definition of the word for the course. Write your definition for it in markdown, writing 2 paragraphs that provide a good introduction to whatever it is.</span></li>
<li><span>Provide 3 links to additional resources, project locations, relevant blog posts, etc about the defined word</span><br/></li>
<li><span>Issue a Pull Request back to the course repository with the name of the topic that you selected as the title of the PR</span></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="header-762bab98-74cb-13ea-2f00-cda79e9ae4be"><span>Writing / screencast / reflection lab submission</span></h3>
<p><span>The reflection this week (writing portion) was creating the pull request that defined a term from the course this semester. For your video, do an explainer video about a topic that surrounds git / github. Some sample ways you could choose to accomplish this:</span></p>
<ul><li><span>Demonstrating how git works by using the Github desktop app to modify a file and sync it up with github</span><br/></li>
<li><span>Demonstrate how a Pull Requests works and what that looks like in the text / code being changed</span></li>
<li><span>Demonstrate how to contribute to repositories running git commands in terminal / command line to contribute to a repository</span></li>
<li>Find a popular github project (like GravCMS, electron, lit-html) and use it as the backdrop for explaining how teams leverage github in order to better collaborate on software projects</li>
<li>Find a popular github project (like above) and use it as the backdrop for examining the health of the software based on things that should be looked for in a healthy software project</li>
</ul>
<p>Your screencast can be about any of the suggestions above or about anything you want to show as long as it is relevant to git, github, gitlab, version control. If you don't think I explained the topic well and you instead find an article that does, it could be explaining what the article is (<i>a few students did this in the past :) </i>
). <b>It could also be showing you talking about proposing changes to a file in a repo, then doing it in the UI and talking about what's happening and how it works.</b>
</p>
<p>I only bold that text <i>because then you'd be saving time</i>
; doing the Lab while talking about doing the lab; which demonstrates you get the concept, while showing someone else how to accomplish the same task.</p>
<p>I am what the army looks for in its officers (there are articles about it so I'm not bs'ing) -- Smart people that are actually really lazy. Smart people who want to focus on how smart they are focus on themselves. Smart people who are lazy, want the task to not have been a thing; solving it in an often elegant manner so as to move forward without needing to know the task ever existed. For them, it's not about credit, it's about getting onto more interesting things.</p>
<p>Solve things demonstrating your smarts but do it in a lazy way this semester. Your time is valuable, and by proxy, so are you, so problem solve like it!</p>
<h3 id="header-64ed5030-ef76-cd1b-3db5-1a8cc128447a"><span>Submitting your video / reflection</span></h3>
<p>To submit your reflection, provide a link to the Pull Request you made in the <b>#lab-2-git</b>
 channel as well as a link to your video submission for the week.</p>
