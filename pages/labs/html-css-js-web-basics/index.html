<h3>Lab 3</h3>
<p>For this lab we're going to be modifying three CodePens. The first one we'll do together in class for practice and getting a feel for HTML / CSS. JavaScript will come up again in the future so we'll keep the JS brief for this one.</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/zYOWqKZ">Exercise Pen</a>
: <span>Fork this Pen and we can follow along together in class.</span></p>
<h2>Lab Pen</h2>
<p>For this lab, I want you to modify <b>one of these</b>
 <b>pens</b>
 in order to make the resume reflect your own information. There's a <i>beginner Pen</i>
 and a more <i>advanced pen</i>
.</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/GRKQVBx?editors=1000">Beginner Pen</a>
: Personal Resume which contains hints and directions inside</p>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/GRKxKgX?editors=1000">Advanced Pen</a>
: no instructions and a slightly more advanced design. Use this to challenge yourself or if you've previously written HTML to make something more useful.</p>
<h3>Reflection Pen</h3>
<p><a href="https://codepen.io/btopro/pen/KKPozvd">FORK THIS PEN</a>
: For reflection this week I want you to fork this pen and write your response using HTML. For the topic this week pick one of the following:</p>
<ul><li>Explaining how to apply styling to an element in <b>CSS</b>
</li>
<li>Explain how to use JavaScript and <b>getElementById</b>
 to add a <i>click event to</i>
 an element in an existing codepen that generates an alert saying <b>Hello</b>
</li>
<li><i>Value of CodePen as a platform</i>
 to learn coding by finding an inspiring pen and explain what's going on.</li>
</ul>
