<h3>Topic / semester outline</h3>
<p>Here's the proposed topics I've come up with to start. We may deviate from here as far as timing or how long we spend on different ones.</p>
<ul><li><b>Week 1 - Establishing an online identity as an
IT Professional (Vlogger)</b>
</li>
<ul><li>Treating ourselves as brands, we will establish
accounts and begin to setup the foundation for submission of assignments
throughout the semester</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 2 – Git / Github / Contribution (All roles)</b>
</li>
<ul><li>Collaborative participation on Github,
understanding concepts of Git / version control and how teams leverage this
technology for code and <b>non-code
projects</b>
</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 3 - Improving our Brand</b>
</li>
<ul><li>Review the other brands being established, offering feedback to classmates as well as reflecting on and internalizing that feedback to improve our own brand for the semester</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><span><b>Week 4 - HTML / CSS / JavaScript & the web (Front end)</b>
</span></li>
<ul><li>The big three powering most of what you use
today, a primer for reverse engineering. We’ll use codepen to demonstrate how
you can extend concepts of github into other realms</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 5 - Reclaim Hosting & CPanel & <a href="https://getgrav.org/">GravCMS</a>
</b>
</li>
<ul><li>We're going to dig into <a href="https://reclaimhosting.com/"><b>Reclaim</b>
 <b>hosting</b>
</a>
 for the next several lessons and to give us a server to deploy CMSs on. CMSs come in different shapes and sizes and this will kick off several weeks looking at different CMSs in depth</li>
<li><b>Reclaim</b>
 uses <a href="https://cpanel.net/">CPanel</a>
 - A hosting management platform which makes installing new applications a click away. We'll explore the CPanel interface and open the door to installing and experimenting with many different applications.</li>
<li>We'll use GravCMS as our first vehicle into CPanels powers. GravCMS is a powerful yet simple static file driven website. It's built in PHP yet reads off <b>Markdown</b>
 files in order to generate content. We'll explore the GravCMS user interface, learn why people use it and look at some sites built using it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 6 - <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress CMS</a>
</b>
</li>
<ul><li>We'll look at the WordPress community and platform as it is the worlds most used open source CMS, thought to power some 30+% of all websites</li>
<li>We'll dig into the WordPress UI, look at the Gutenberg editor, and see why more people build smaller websites using WordPress than any other platform out there today</li>
<li>We'll talk about "Forks" through the lens of ClassicPress which is a popular fork of WordPress caused as a result of the Gutenberg editor</li>
<li>We'll setup a basic WordPress site in <b>Reclaim</b>
 <b>hosting</b>
 to explore the guts of our own real working WordPress site.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 7 - <a href="https://drupal.org/">Drupal CMS</a>
</b>
<br/></li>
<ul>
<li>We'll look at the Drupal community, it's history, structure and learn about why it's popular at a high level<br/></li>
<li>We'll dig into the Drupal UI and look at the more powerful aspects of it as to why people put up for lack of UX in exchange for raw power like User / role management and entity / field management<br/></li>
<li>We'll setup a basic Drupal site in <b>Reclaim</b>
 <b>hosting</b>
 to explore the guts of our own real working Drupal site.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 8 - Drupal, revenge</b>
<br/></li>
<ul><li>Given the interest and relative complexity of Drupal, we'll cover it in greater detail. This lab will focus on digging into the Drupal modules, permissions and roles system in order to start to convert our data modeling into a full blown headless API!</li>
<li>It sounds more complicated then it is so don't get overwhelmed, Drupal really begins to shine when you understand the concepts it allows for. We won't have to write any code in order to identify and build out a headless API that talks to codepen!</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 9 - Spring Break</b>
</li>
<ul><li>Sleep and catch up on labs</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 10 - <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/haxcms">HAXcms</a>
 / FOSS governance / User experience</b>
</li>
<ul><li>HAXcms is an experimental, incredibly lightweight content management system that my team is working on. I've dubbed it a new breed of system called an <b>organic static site generator</b>
. Traditional static site generators require command line to work and modify. Traditional CMSs require databases or backend processing in order to operate. HAXcms uses backend processing to write things to a portable static format on every operation. It means you could zip a site up in a single folder, hand it to another person, and they could open it up in their copy of HAXcms and start working on it. It also means that those same files can live on things like github and serve a highly dynamic website to people without a complex backend. It's a bit trippy... and it's the future of all things being pioneered at your institution of choice :)</li>
<li>The HAX portion of HAXcms is short for Headless Authoring eXperience - meaning that it can be portable and plugged into any system. As a result, we'll go back to Drupal, Grav and WordPress and see what it's like to have a unified authoring experience in these spaces.</li>
<li>We’ll review governance within open source
communities, understand the difference between licenses, learn how different structures operate (including Open vs Closed), see how to identify
healthy vs stagnated open source communities, and learn when people fallback to proprietary technologies. ELMS:LN / HAXcms had to go through a formal audit from the <a href="https://apereo.org/">Apereo Foundation</a>
, so I'll provide insight into what got us certified as a well formed software community.</li>
<li>We'll perform a blind UX audit of HAXcms leveraging a technique in which you work with a partner to accomplish a specific task in order to identify gaps in the UX. I will demonstrate this technique first before we do it together in class.</li>
<li>We'll continue to play with HAXcms and create a basic website in it, identifying issues run into and submitting them to the project issues queue as needed. Video and exercise for this week will be related to creating a documentation site about the experience of using HAX.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 11 - Server Virtualization technologies (DevOps)</b>
</li>
<ul><li>Vagrant, Docker, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm and other virtualization tech has changed the web forever,
we’ll explore these and surrounding applications and learn why they are so
powerful</li>
<li>We'll use the <a href="https://labs.play-with-docker.com/">PlayWithDocker</a>
 web service in order to get hands on with Docker and better understand what it's doing and why it transform business process from a security and timeline perspective</li>
<li>We will most likely have a guest join us this week, Michael Potter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dG4iyrEQt4">who is pioneering the future of microservice architecture</a>
 tied to visual front end assets to invoke them.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 12 - Web components & Package management & Progressive Web Apps (Front end)</b>
<br/></li>
<ul>
<li><span>HTML on steroids and the future of all application development, web or otherwise</span><br/></li>
<li><span>We’ll look at why this is transformative for application development and why all teams should be exploring it from an efficiency perspective. We’ll also experiment with a powerful new platform called Stackblitz to demonstrate the power of Package management + compartmentalized HTML</span><br/></li>
<li><span>NPM / Composer and how we stand on the shoulders of giants</span></li>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 13 – </b>
 <b>Designing Accessible User experiences</b>
<br/></li>
<ul>
<li><span>What is it, why is it important, who benefits, how do we test for it?</span><br/></li>
<li><span>We'll use assistive technology, lighthouse and Webaim's Wave plugin to test websites and understand the reports and feedback that these tools give us</span><br/></li>
<li><span>The lab this week, we'll leverage the tools discussed on real websites to find accessibility issues in a code pen and other spaces to demonstrate technique and explain how to diagnose accessibility issues to others.</span><br/></li>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><span>Persona creation and build real world accessible applications</span><br/></li>
<li><span>We'll learn about the process of building accessible applications prior to code development and leading into application development</span><br/></li>
<li><span>We'll look at platforms our team has been working on and have a guest lecture by Nikki Massaro-Kaufmann, UX lead on HAXTheWeb web component projects</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 14 – Exam / Introduction of OER final project</b>
</li>
<ul><li>Class 1: Exam. Finish and your welcome to leave</li>
<li>Class 2: Establishing what the final project is</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Week 15-16 - EdTech / OER / Course project</b>
</li>
<ul><li>We’ll look at the courses we’re taking and its
usage of technology, where this technology is usable, where it’s not. Where
accessibility can be improved or accounted for.</li>
<li>We’ll look at OER / open course technology
movements from philosophical, societal and technological perspectives.</li>
<li>We’ll audit systems the instructor works on /
has worked on to identify gaps in existing technologies, critique what’s
available and think about how technologies discussed throughout the class can
be leveraged</li>
<li><b>These labs will be combined into a single submission with 10% of the grade. Lab time will be spent learning about the context and having access to instructors to help while exploring the topic.</b>
</li>
</ul>
